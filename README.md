## stickman

Stickman is a micro-framework using [Amphp](https://amphp.org/) and its still under development.

The main idea at this point is to allow Attribute defined routes and use the [Auryn injector](https://github.com/rdlowrey/auryn).

Example configuration and a "controller" can be found in the `app/` folder.

In TODO.md you can find some of my inner thoughts.

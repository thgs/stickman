# Todo list

For alpha

1. Sort out the route collection so it works with a dir/namespace given ?
2. Sort out those requires like we did for PhpFileContainerConfiguration
3. Remove those *Collections, we need something better?
4. Allow an external router to come in
5. Write docs
6. Write more interfaces
7. Check what else is not covered from Amphp
8. ServerObserver
9. Trailers?
10. Performance and running on prod? 
11. Check the rest of the addons how they can integrate optionally?
12. Write tests
13. Review the classes public methods, maybe make the exported api better?

For beta?

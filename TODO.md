# Todo list

For alpha

1. Sort out the route collection so it works with a dir/namespace given ?
2. Sort out those requires like we did for PhpFileContainerConfiguration
3. Remove those *Collections, we need something better?

4. Allow an external router to come in
5. Write docs
6. Write more interfaces

7. Check what else is not covered from Amphp
8. ServerObserver
9. Trailers?
10. Performance and running on prod? 
11. Check the rest of the addons how they can integrate optionally?

12. Write tests
13. Review the classes public methods, maybe make the exported api better?

14. ~~Support PSR container~~ removed
15. Make Stickman more than configuration (oh yea?)
16. ~~Change to early instantiation rather than on-request that it is now~~

17. Make Dispatcher a bit extendable/add interface? So people can add things like arguments resolution

18. Add group/prefix and middleware as a new class attribute

For beta?

1. PSR-12 ?



Stickman :: Container -> Handlers -> Servers -> Options -> logname -> HttpServer
